# The-Chain
Blockchain implementation written in Python.

# Running the blockchain
To run the blockchain:

```
git clone https://github.com/CianOSullivan/The-Chain
cd The-Chain
python3 src/main.py
```

This will start the flask server and initialise the blockchain with the genesis node.
To access the blockchain, navigate to https://localhost:5000 and use the 'transaction' and 'mine' tabs to interact with it.
